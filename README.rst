json2cmake
==========

|Build Status| |PyPI version|

``json2cmake`` converts `JSON compilation database`_ files into `CMake`_
files. The resulting ``CMakeLists.txt`` file can then be used to
recompile the same object files with less overhead via `Ninja`_, used as
an IDE project file for `CLion`_, or for integration into a larger CMake
project.

The output files only include `object library`_ definitions, as a
``compile_commands.json`` file typically doesn't contain any linker
commands.

Installation
------------

``json2cmake`` is available as a ``pip`` package, and can be installed
like so:

::

    $ pip install --user json2cmake

`pipsi`_ is a useful tool to keep scripts out of other Python
environments and virtualenvs:

::

    $ pipsi install json2cmake

Usage
-----

Simply run ``json2cmake`` in the directory containing
``compile_commands.json``:

::

    $ json2cmake
    $ cat CMakeLists.txt
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.8)
    project(autogenerated)
    ...
