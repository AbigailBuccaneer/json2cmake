# json2cmake

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AbigailBuccaneer/json2cmake.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AbigailBuccaneer/json2cmake)
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/json2cmake.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/json2cmake)

`json2cmake` converts [JSON compilation database][] files into [CMake][] files.
The resulting `CMakeLists.txt` file can then be used to recompile the same object files with less overhead via [Ninja][], used as an IDE project file for [CLion][], or for integration into a larger CMake project.

The output files only include [object library][] definitions, as a `compile_commands.json` file typically doesn't contain any linker commands.
